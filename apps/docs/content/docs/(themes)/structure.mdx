import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

The basic structure of a theme consists of two files: `main.css` and `manifest.json`. The `main.css` file contains all the CSS code that defines the appearance of the theme, while the `manifest.json` file provides metadata about the theme, such as its name, author, and version.

<Files>
	<Folder name="my-theme" defaultOpen>
		<File name="main.css" />
		<File name="manifest.json" />
	</Folder>
</Files>

The `manifest.json` file should follow this structure:

```json
{
	"name": "My Theme",
	"author": "Your Name",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A brief description of your theme."
}
```
